This ability needs to be implemented by the developer himself.

The frontend only needs to parse the control code of the backend to render the corresponding style. For example, the cmd of Windows, the terminal of Mac, various SSH clients, etc. The display of these terminals is controlled by <code>ANSI Control Code</code>.</p><h3 id="front-end-control" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-control"><span>front-end control</span></a></h3><p>How the terminal content is displayed is controlled by the front end.
